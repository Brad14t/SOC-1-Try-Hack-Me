Soc Simulator Phishing Unfolded from Try Hack Me

# Suspicious Email Alert ID 1006

Looking at the details of the ticket, I can see a weird looking email, and a suspicious subject line, stating discounted vacation packages.

I search for any event with that same subject, and find 2 entries. `Hats Off to Savings: Discounted Vacation Packages Just for You!`

I can see both events are from similar looking emails.

Possible malicious emails:

marc@trendymillineryco.me
tim@chicmillinerydesigns.de

Then I looked up anything received by `invoice@tryhatme.com`

I found this other suspicous email. Ill add that email to the sus list.

I see a lot of emails coming from that domain, so I will check with the analyst tools.

The analyst tools show them as clean, but this is SPAM, and the user does not need these emails.
