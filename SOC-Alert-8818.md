# SOC-Alert-8818

First I read over the given writeup.

First query will be to find anything else sent by the sender `index=* sender=onboarding@hrconnex.thm`

2 results came back and its the same email in the ticket twice, just 30 minutes apart.

Searching for anything containing the URL in the email `index=* hrconnex.thm`

The only results I get is the email in question and a previous email saying the user didnt have the authentication email sent to them yet.

Everything is pointing to this is legit, I will check the artificats in the given lookup tool.

To me everything seems legit, I will start my report now.
