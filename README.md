# ðŸš€ Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Project

This repository showcases my hands on experience and foundational expertise in security operations and incident response, developed through the Try Hack Me SOC Level 1 learning path and targeted phishing simulations. By leveraging industry standard tools and methodologies, this project demonstrates a practical application of core security principles to monitor, detect, and respond to real world cyber threats. 

**Key Competencies Demonstrated**

`Incident Triage & Management:` Executed initial triage and investigation of security events, effectively determining priority and escalating incidents in accordance with established procedures.

`SIEM Monitoring & Analysis:` Proficient in leveraging Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms to perform log analysis, correlate security events, and identify anomalous activities.

`Threat Detection & Hunting:` Demonstrated ability to detect malicious activity and indicators of compromise (IoCs) by analyzing network traffic, email headers, and endpoint behavior.

`Phishing Incident Response:` Investigated simulated phishing campaigns, dissecting malicious emails, analyzing header information, and tracing the attack vector to mitigate potential impact.

`Malware Analysis (Basic):` Performed initial analysis of malware related alerts to understand the threat and facilitate appropriate response actions.
`Security Reporting & Documentation:` Developed comprehensive incident reports and documented investigation steps, ensuring clear communication and maintaining a complete chain of custody for security incidents.

`Technical Communication:` Collaborated within a simulated environment to facilitate efficient incident resolution and improve overall security posture. 

**Project Highlights**

`Proactive Threat Mitigation:` Successfully identified and neutralized simulated threats, reinforcing practical skills in protecting digital assets.

`Structured Incident Response:` Followed defined incident response protocols to ensure a systematic and effective approach to containing and eradicating threats.

`Continuous Improvement Mindset:` The experience has reinforced a commitment to continuous learning and staying current with evolving cybersecurity trends and threat intelligence.
