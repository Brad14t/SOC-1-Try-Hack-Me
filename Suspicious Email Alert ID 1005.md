First I will look at the details provided.

First search I will do is looking at event with that same subject `Shrinking Hat Sale: Tiny Hats for Extraordinary People`

I only got the 1 event.

Then I searched for any events containing the employee or sender in this ticket. `sophie.j@tryhatme.com`

Going through the 7 events, I can see this employee is sending this email out to other people.

But I found this one that looks a little weird, I will run the senders email through the TryDetectThis to see if malicous.

url came back as clean.

I feel comfortable this is a false positive, nothing malicious is present to me. And the user has sent this email out before.
