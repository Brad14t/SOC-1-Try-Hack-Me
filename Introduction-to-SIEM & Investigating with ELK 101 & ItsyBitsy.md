# ItsyBitsy

**1. What is the IP associated with the suspected user in the logs?**

Second option is what I am looking for.

I first filter for only the malicous IP.

Then look for `user_agent` value.

**3. The infected machine connected with a famous filesharing site in this period, which also acts as a C2 server used by the malware authors to communicate. What is the name of the filesharing site?**

Looking at the same entry I can find this under the field `host` and the value is the answer.

**4. What is the full URL of the C2 to which the infected host is connected?**

To answer this, we already have the first part, I just add the field `uri`'s value to the end of the `host`

`pastebin.com/yTg0Ah6a`

**5. A file was accessed on the filesharing site. What is the name of the file accessed?**

I enter the url into my search bar and can find the answer there.
